    <p class="flashy">Welcome to Charly’s Bakery, home of Charly’s Cake Angels, situated in District 6,
       <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town">Cape Town</a>, South Africa.
    </p>
    <p>
     We specialise in Mucking Afazing designer cakes for all occasions, as well as a range of fun and bright cupcakes,
     petit fours, cookies and other yummies.
    </p>
    <p class="flashy">Charly’s Bakery is a family run business, started by Charly and Jacqui Biess in 1989.
    </p>
    <p>
    Over the years the business has grown and their 3 daughters, Alexandra,
    Daniella and Roch have joined them in creating their crazy,
    magical, glitter-filled world of Oompa Loompas, Luf Luf and decadently Wicked Chocolate cake.
    </p>
    <p class="flashy">
    We believe that the world is run on love, laughter and cupcakes!
    </p>
    <p>
    In 2012 our beloved Charly left this world but not our hearts.
    Tata Charly, we will meet you again… Somewhere Over the Rainbow ♥
